//Given a function that accepts a number(n) as a parameter, return an array with every number from 1 to n
//EXCEPTION: if a number is divisable by 3 that array element should be replaced with the string "Fizz"
//EXCEPTION: if a number is divisable by 5 that array element should be replaced with the string "Buzz"
//EXCEPTION: if a number is divisable by 15 that array element should be replaced with the string "FizzBuzz"
//If number given is 5, function should return: [1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz]
//If number given is 17, function should return: [1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11,
//Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz, 16, 17]

//HINT: after you create an array, you want to use the .push() method to add a value to an array
